# libdisc

A pet project aiming to implement Discord's bot API in C. Mostly done so I can
learn more about HTTP, WebSockets, and event handling. Also to practice my C.

If you're thinking of using this project to write a Discord bot, I urge you to
reconsider for multiple reasons:

1. There are probably more robust (read: actively developed) options for libraries for your purposes.
2. There are probably more acceptable (read: privacy/freedom-respecting) messaging platforms for your purposes.
